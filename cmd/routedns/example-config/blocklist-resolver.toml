# Simple configuration for "blocklist-v2" that uses alternative resolvers for
# queries that match the allowlist or blocklist. The default behavior is to
# return NXDOMAIN for any item that matches the blocklist but not the allowlist.
# With resolvers, it's possible to send queries to different resolvers based
# on them matching the allowlist or blocklist, similar to a router. This is
# useful when the blocklist should return something other than NXDOMAIN, the
# query can be routed to a statis-responder instead, providing more control
# over what is returned.
